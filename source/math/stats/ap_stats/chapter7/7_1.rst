What is a Sampling Distribution?
################################

Parameters and Statistics
=========================

.. sidebar:: Parameters

  A number that describes a characteristic of a **population**

  Example: Population mean (:math:`\mu`)

.. sidebar:: Statistic

  A number that describes a characteristic of a **sample**

  Example: Sample mean (:math:`\bar{x}`)

Parameters are usually not known because we cannot examine an entire population.
However, a Statistic can be taken directly from the sample data.

.. note::

	:math:`p` represents a Population Proportion while :math:`\hat{p}` represents the Sample Proportion (used to estimate unknown parameter :math:`p`)

Example:

``A poll asked a random sample of 515 U.S. adults whether or not they believe
in ghosts. Of the respondents, 160 said “Yes.”``

What is the **population**, the **parameter**, the **sample**, and the **Statistic** in the problem?

Population:
  All U.S. adults

Parameter:
  The proportion of the adults that believe in ghosts

Sample:
  The 515 people interviewed

Statistic:
  :math:`\frac{160}{512} = 0.31`, the proportion of the sample that believes in ghosts
