A Special Number
################


Euler's Number
================

More commonly known as :math:`e`, Euler's Number is the area under
:math:`f(x) = \frac{1}{x}` on the interval :math:`[1, x]` where
:math:`x \in [1, 3]` such that :math:`f(x) = 1`.

This number has many practical applications, but for this course it is used
for calculating *Interest*


Compound Interest with :math:`e`
********************************

Interest is *compounded*, or added to the original value, in one of two ways;
at regular intervals or continuously.

.. sidebar:: Variables:

  * :math:`A(t)` - Amount after :math:`t` Years
  * :math:`P` - Principal (Initial Value)
  * :math:`r` - APR (Annual Percent Rate, decimal)
  * :math:`t` - Number of Years
  * :math:`n` - Number of Compounds per Year


Compounding at Regular Intervals
--------------------------------

Formula:
  :math:`A(t) = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}`

Interest is Compounded (*added*) to the Principal (*Initial Value*, :math:`P`) at
Regular Intervals each year (:math:`n`) for a certain number of years (:math:`t`)


Compounding Continuously
------------------------

Formula:
  :math:`A(t) = Pe^{rt}`

Interest is Compounded (*added*) to the Principal (*Initial Value*, :math:`P`) over
a Theoretically Infinite number of Intervals for a certain number of years (:math:`e^{rt}`)
