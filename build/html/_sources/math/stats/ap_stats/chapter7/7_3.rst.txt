Sample Means
############

Unlike *Sample Proportions* that are used for categorical data, *Sample Means*
:math:`\bar{x}` is the most common statistic computed from quantitative data.


Sampling Distribution of :math:`\bar{x}`
========================================

When we choose many SRSs from a population, the sampling distribution of the
sample mean is centered at the population mean :math:`\mu` and is less spread
out than the population distribution.

.. note::

  Given :math:`\bar{x}` is the mean of an SRS of size :math:`n` taken from a
  large population with mean :math:`\mu` and standard deviation :math:`\sigma`,
  then:

  * The **mean** of the Sampling Distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` is :math:`\mu_\bar{x}=\mu`
  * the **standard deviation** of the sampling distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` is

  .. math::

  	\sigma_\bar{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

  as long as the 10% condition is met: :math:`n \leq \frac{1}{10}N`

:math:`\bar{x}` in repeated samples acts similarly to the sample proportion :math:`\hat{p}`:

* :math:`\bar{x}` is an *unbiased estimator* of the population mean :math:`\mu`
* The values of :math:`\bar{x}` are less spread out for larger samples

  * Their standard deviation decreases at the rate :math:`\sqrt{n}`

* Use the formula  :math:`\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` for the standard deviation
  of :math:`\bar{x}` only when the population is at least 10 times as large as
  the sample

.. note::

  These facts about the mean and standard deviation of :math:`\bar{x}` are true
  *no matter the shape of the population distribution*


Sampling from a Normal Population
=================================

The Shape of the distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` depends on the shape of the
population distribution. If the Population Distribution is Normal, then so is
the Sampling Distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` *regardless of the sample size*.

.. note::

  Given a population that is Normally Distributed with mean :math:`\mu` and
  standard deviation :math:`\sigma`, then the sampling distribution of
  :math:`\bar{x}` is Normally Distributed with mean :math:`\mu` and standard
  deviation :math:`\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` (assuming 10% condition is met)


Calculating Probabilities involving :math:`\bar{x}`
***************************************************

Example Problem:

  The height of young women follows a Normal Distribution with mean
  :math:`\mu = 64.5` inches and standard deviation :math:`\sigma = 2.5` inches.

  1. Find the probability that a randomly selected young woman is taller than 66.5 inches.
  2. Find the probability that the mean height of an SRS of 10 young women exceeds 66.5 inches

  Solution for 1.

    1. :math:`z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{66.5 - 64.5}{2.5} = 0.80`
    2. Using a Normal Distribution Table, :math:`P(z > 0.80) = 1 - 0.7881 = 0.2119`

  Solution for 2.

    1. :math:`\mu_\bar{x} = \mu = 64.5` inches
    2. :math:`\sigma_\bar{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{2.5}{\sqrt{10}} = 0.79`
    3. :math:`z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{66.5 - 64.5}{0.79} = 2.53`
    4. Using a Normal Distribution Table, :math:`P(z > 2.53) = 1 - 0.9943 = 0.0057`

.. note::

  The averages of several observation are less variable than the individual
  observations.


Central Limit Theorem
=====================

Definition:
  Given an SRS of size :math:`n` from any population with mean :math:`\mu` and
  finite standard deviation :math:`\sigma`, if :math:`n` is sufficiently large,
  the sampling distribution of the sample mean :math:`\bar{x}` is approximately
  Normal.

Regardless of the shape of a population distribution, the sampling distribution
of :math:`\bar{x}` becomes more Normal as the sample size :math:`n` increases.

.. note::

  * If the population distribution is Normal, so is the sampling distribution
    of :math:`\bar{x}`, regardless of the sample size.
  * If the population distribution is not Normal, the **Central Limit Theorem**
    states that the sampling distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` will be approximately
    Normal in most cases is :math:`n \geq 30`.


Summary
================

The **sampling distribution of** :math:`\bar{x}` describes how the statistic
:math:`\bar{x}` varies in *all* possible samples of the same size from the
population.

The **mean** of the sampling distribution is :math:`\mu`, so :math:`\bar{x}` is
an  unbiased estimator of :math:`\mu`.

The **standard deviation** of the sampling distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` is
:math:`frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` for an SRS of size :math:`n` if the population has
standard deviation :math:`\sigma`.

  * Formula can be used if population is at least 10 times as large as the sample

If the population distribution is Normal, so is the sampling distribution
of :math:`\bar{x}`. If the population distribution is not Normal, the
**central limit theorem** states that when :math:`n` is large, the sampling
distribution of :math:`\bar{x}` is approximately Normal.

We can use a Normal distribution to calculate approximate probabilities for
events involving :math:`\bar{x}` whenever the Normal/Large Sample condition is met:

  * If the population distribution is Normal, so is the sampling distribution of :math:`\bar{x}`.
  * If :math:`n \geq 30`, the CLT tells us that the sampling distribution of
    :math:`\bar{x}` will be approximately Normal in most cases
