Centripetal Acceleration
########################


From Kinematics we know that *acceleration* is a change in velocity, either in its
magnitude or its velocity, or both. In Uniform Circular Motion, the direction of
the velocity changes constantly, so there is always an associated acceleration.

The image shows an object moving in a circular path at a constant speed. Given
vectors :math:`v_1 \text{ and } v_2`, the acceleration is in the direction of
the change in velocity (vector :math:`\Delta v`) which points directly to the
center of curvature.

To calculate the magnitude of the acceleration, we can use the triangle formed
by the velocity vectors and the one formed by the radii :math:`r \text{ and } \Delta s`.
Since both triangles are isosceles triangles (two equal sides) the two equal
sides of the velocity vector triangles are the speeds :math:`v_1 = v_2 = v` and
we can use the properties of two similar triangles to obtain:

.. math::

	\frac{\Delta v}{v} = \frac{\Delta s}{r}

Because acceleration is :math:`\Delta v / \Delta t`, we can solve for :math:`\Delta v`

.. math::

	\Delta v = \frac{v}{r} \Delta s

We can divide by :math:`\Delta t` which yields,

.. math::

	\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v}{r} \times \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}

We know that :math:`v = \Delta s / \Delta t`  and :math:`a_c = \Delta v / \Delta t`
so we can see that the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is

.. math::

	a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}

which is the acceleration of an object in a circle of radius :math:`r` at a
speed :math:`v`. Therefore, centripetal acceleration is greater at higher speeds
and sharp curves (smaller radius).

.. note::

  :math:`a_c` is proportional to speed squared, therefore, for example, it is
  four times as hard to take a curve at 100 km/h than at 50 km/

We can also express centripetal acceleration in terms of *angular velocity* by
substituting :math:`v = r\omega` into the expression above we find

.. math::

	a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}; a_c = r\omega^2
